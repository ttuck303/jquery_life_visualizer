TO DO

2. fix the width so that the entire thing can be seen on a single page
3. incorporate other milestones like they do in the article (superbowls, for example, or books)
4. figure out how to style it up a bit more so it looks sleek rather than 95 DOS
8. refactor draw methods into one method
10. decouple button pressing and update page methods so that you can update the page when the datepicker is closed without also selecting an option button
11. format the datepicker alert text so that its human readable
12. check birthdate and enter snarky alert if the date is in the future
13. create more white space in canvas
14. properly center drawings in the canvas window


TO DO COMPLETED
5. return the age as a decimal (currently returns as an integer)
6. clean up the structure of the JS according to the video you saw last night [NOTE: had to add objName. before each method call, not sure that is how its supposed to go...]
1. if any button is clicked but a birthday isn't entered, send an alert to enter the birthday
9. make birthday update when datepicker is finished, rather than entering it with datepicker THEN pushing the button 
7. round the age to the nearest unit for display (currently rounding up)
