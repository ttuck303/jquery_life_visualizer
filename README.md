TO DO
1. if any button is clicked but a birthday isn't entered, send an alert to enter the birthday
2. fix the width so that the entire thing can be seen on a single page
3. incorporate other milestones like they do in the article (superbowls, for example, or books)
4. figure out how to style it up a bit more so it looks sleek rather than 95 DOS

7. round the age to the nearest unit for display (currently rounding up)
8. refactor draw methods into one method

TO DO COMPLETED
5. return the age as a decimal (currently returns as an integer)
6. clean up the structure of the JS according to the video you saw last night [NOTE: had to add objName. before each method call, not sure that is how its supposed to go...]
